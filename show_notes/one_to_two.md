# Python Programing: One to Two
In this episode of the show, we discus how to get up to speed with python program, particularly focusing on material beyond the very most fundamental material.  

## Finding Your Spark
Most introductions to python (or other computing languages) tend to survey the mechanics of code. They introduce you to things like variables, loops, and conditional logic. There might even be a toy project a the end.  A common challenge most learners encounter is that they struggle to find meaningful ways of applying their new skill set, and inevitably the skill set they worked so hard to aquire atrophies and dies.  The best way to continue to grow your skill set is to apply your programming ability to automate some task.

### Projects to Start Off With
Here are a few of the projects referenced in the episode.

<li><a href="https://github.com/drJAGartner/pi_day">Estimating Pi through simulations</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/drJAGartner/stream_twitter">Get data from twitter</a></li>
</ol>

### Computer Science Fundamentals
Once you have expanded the *what* of your ability, you'll quickly want to make your code better.  The next step is to work on getting better at computer science fundamentals.  Our favorite text is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-Eastern-Economy-Thomas/dp/8120340078/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=E89EJX3QQW8N9JNG4MJG">Introduction to Algorythms</a>, and has been a CS staple for years.  The book gets into deep water pretty quickly, but the early chapters will give you a ton of room for getting up and running on thinking about how your underlying programs work.
